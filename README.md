"Ice Cream Heaven" is your ultimate sugary sanctuary where cones reign supreme and brain freeze is a badge of honor! This playful website serves up delicious ice cream facts, a flavor generator that's more unpredictable than a melted scoop on a hot day, and contact info so you can scream (politely) about your favorite flavors. Our 404 page features a melted ice cream cone - because sometimes life (and websites) get a little messy. Why did the ice cream website break up with the salad site? It couldn't handle the dressing! Remember: this site is 99% dairy-free, but 100% committed to cheesy jokes. Just don't tell the cookies-and-cream section we said it was "crumby" - it's a little sensitive.


Shipped an ice cream fan site featuring a flavor generator, animated footer character, and custom 404 page, built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS after being haunted by the local ice cream truck's jingle - used AI for basic scaffolding and debugging footer CSS, but the real magic came from manually adding ridiculous flavors like "Existential Crisis Crunch"; currently resisting urge to implement a "Track That Damn Truck" API feature.
